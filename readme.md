F3 screenshots. Very useful for developers when your game is having problems. But they are not without their flaws:
* If your window resolution is small enough (or your GUI scale is large enough), sometimes the F3 menu doesn't actually fit on your screen. And sometimes it overlaps with itself.
* Since Minecraft 1.21.9, you can now customize what information gets shown on your F3 menu. This is useful for users, but annoying for developers trying to help you, because they might need information that you have hidden.

That's where this mod comes in: pressing F2 while holding down F3 will save all your F3 data to an organized .txt file in your screenshots folder, not just the information that you have configured to be visible. Additionally, this file will also be copied to your clipboard, so you can easily paste it into Discord to share with whichever developer you're complaining to.

Developers will thank you for using this mod.

As an extra bonus feature, saving a normal screenshot will *also* copy it to your clipboard, similar to the [Screenshot to Clipboard](https://modrinth.com/mod/screenshot-to-clipboard) mod.
